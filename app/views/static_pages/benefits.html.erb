					<h3>Who Can Join?</h3>
					<p>Anyone interested in getting outdoors to go walking, climbing and mountaineering with other like minded people.</p>
					<p>We don't set limitations on experience to become a member, however we do expect you to be able to enjoy your chosen activity safely. You'll need to own the basic gear and have a basic knowledge to be able to take part, eg: for climbing you'll need a harness and shoes and know how to belay.</p>
					<p>If you want to climb but haven't ever done so before then we suggest a course at a climbing wall as a good starting point - The Leeds Wall offer such courses.</p>
					<p>Under 18s can join the club, however there are limitations on which meets under 18s can attend.</p>

				<h3>Activities</h3>
				<p>The main activities undertaken by members are walking and climbing. Walking can be anything from a potter round a nearby lake in the rain to a full on 30km hike across the fells. Most climbers climb trad routes and also indoors. Members also go sport climbing in the UK and Europe as well as tackling alpine routes and Via Ferrata.
				<p>In the winter members also go winter climbing and skiing, including touring and ski mountaineering and there are also a number who mountain bike throughout the year.</p>
