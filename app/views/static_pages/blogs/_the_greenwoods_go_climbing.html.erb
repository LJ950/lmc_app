<p>Anna and I headed over to Borrowdale for a few days. We camped in the site just up from Rosthwaite. &pound;6 per person, per night, warm showers at 50p a go, but no hot water otherwise. Sunday afternoon we climbed at Quay foot Buttress getting a couple of good routes: Mandrake HVS and Abberation MVS. As Anna is not leading at the moment i had the pleasure of leading all the pitches over our break in the Lakes. Monday we headed up to Buckstone How, above Honister, but a bitter wind sent us scurrying back down into the valley. So we opted for Black Crag where we climbed Holly Tree Corner VS and Raindrop E1. Anna and Junior did a great job of seconding me on Raindrop, I know he or she is safely in Anna's tummy but no harm in starting Junior early! Tuesday we headed to Lower Falcon Crag. There is a bird nesting restriction on the left side of the crag, but the classic VS Spinup is still open so we started there. Next we climbed Illusion HVS. If you have your sights on A Dream Of White Horses this year then Illusion is a good inland warm up, but probably a bit harder, as it takes an exposed traverse under a large over hang and crosses a grove or two on occasionally questionable rock. Doesn't sound like a good route, now i have described it, but i assure you it was! Wednesday we got our day at Buckstone How. Fantastic views on excellent lines, an awesome mountain crag. We ascended Sinister Grooves (including a very hard VS pitch) and Alexas HVS before returning to down camp and head home for a rest. We did plan on returning this weekend after watching the Royal Wedding, but these strong Easterly winds unfortunately put us off. Still gave us a chance to go bike shopping instead.</p>

<p>New member Wayne and I went to Ilkley quarry for the afternoon. He confessed to not being a crack climber so why not!! He chose S Crack as the first route and was very pleased to ascend it clean. I repeated Waleska, without any particularly large cams so it felt a little run out! Wayne then ascended Josephine Super Direct, stopping on a bird poop covered break to tie his shoe laces and ensure his backside was covered in sufficient crusty mess. then as the sun left us and the cold crept up i finished our evening on Bulcher, which I realised was a rare new VS for me in the Quarry. Well done Wayne, good climbing for a non jamming aficionado. </p>
